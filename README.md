# Cryptographer

<p>CRYPTOGRAPHER is a CLI tool built in python for demonstrating different Encryption Decryption Techniques. Currently the module has
<ul>
  <li>Ceaser Cipher</li>
  <li>RSA</li>
  <li>Affine Cipher</li>
  <li>Rail Fence Cipher</li>
  <li>Vigenere Cipher</li>
</ul>
</p> 
The following are fully useable for encrypting and decrypting text :
<ul>
  <li>Ceaser Cipher</li>
  <li>Affine Cipher</li>
  <li>Vigenere Cipher</li>
</ul>

while the following can be used for encryption only :
<ul>
  <li>RSA</li>
  <li>Rail Fence Cipher</li>
</ul>

Both RSA Algorithm and Rail Fence Cipher will be shortly completed and updated. 
CHAO!
